# Pattern Recognition Grand Challenge 2018 
The goal of Pattern Recognition Grand Challenge (PRGC) 2018 is to predict a subject's emotional state from the fMRI image of his or her brain. In the PINES dataset below, 183 subjects' fMRI images and emotional states are provided. Build a model to predict a subject's emotional state (Y) from an fMRI image (X).
